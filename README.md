# Morph for MongoDB

Morph is a PHP library to map between PHP objects and MongoDB Documents

*NOTICE* - I plan on switching to using namespaces and as such will only support PHP 5.3+, the namespaced branch already exists for anyone wanting to give it a try. It should be fully functional by documentation is not yet up to date.
